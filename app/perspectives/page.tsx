            Minnesota’s new Paid Family and Medical Leave program is set to significantly impact employers starting January 1, 2026. While most Minnesota employers will participate in the state-run paid leave program, there is an alternative: offering an equivalent private plan. For employers considering this option, it’s critical to understand the requirements, benefits, and compliance obligations.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">What is Minnesota Paid Leave?</h2>

            Minnesota Paid leave is a state-mandated insurance program providing eligible employees with partial wage replacement for qualifying medical and family reasons. The program is funded by premiums paid by both employers and employees and covers nearly all private and public employers in the state.
